Great diagnostic screenshots!  
This is a **classic Django + nginx media file serving issue**. Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

---

## **What’s Happening**

- **Django admin** shows the image as `deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg` (relative to your `MEDIA_ROOT`).
- The image link is:  
  `https://api.tumingle.com/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg`
- **Nginx returns 404** for that URL.

---

## **Root Cause**

Nginx is not finding the file at `/app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg` (or wherever your `MEDIA_ROOT` is mapped).

This is almost always due to one of these:
1. The file does not exist at the expected location on disk.
2. The nginx config’s `alias` path does not match the actual location of your media files.
3. The file permissions prevent nginx from reading the file.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **Step 1: Check Where the File Actually Is**

SSH into your server or use your shell and run:
```bash
ls -l /app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg
```
- If you don’t see the file, check where your Django `MEDIA_ROOT` is actually pointing.
- If you’re running Django in Docker, `/app/media/` must be mapped to the host directory where uploads are stored.

### **Step 2: Check Your Nginx Config**

You have:
```nginx
location /media/ {
    alias /app/media/;
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```
- This means nginx expects the file at `/app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg`.

### **Step 3: Check Django Settings**

In `settings.py`:
```python
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
```
- If `BASE_DIR` is `/app`, then `/app/media/` is correct.
- If not, adjust the nginx `alias` to match the actual path.

### **Step 4: Check File Permissions**

Make sure the file and all parent directories are readable by the nginx user:
```bash
sudo chmod -R a+rX /app/media/
```

### **Step 5: If Using Docker**

- Make sure your Docker volume mounts the media directory correctly:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./media:/app/media
  ```

---

## **Quick Checklist**

- [ ] Does the file exist at `/app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg`?
- [ ] Does nginx’s `alias` match the actual path?
- [ ] Are permissions correct?
- [ ] Is your Docker volume mapping correct (if using Docker)?

---

## **How to Test**

1. SSH into your server.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   ls -l /app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg
   ```
   - If you see the file, permissions are likely OK.
   - If not, find where Django is saving uploads and adjust nginx accordingly.

3. Try accessing the file directly via the browser again.

---

## **If the File is Missing**

- It means Django is saving uploads somewhere else.
- Check your `MEDIA_ROOT` and where the file is actually being saved.

**Let me know the result of `ls -l /app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg` and I’ll guide you further!**  
If you want, paste your Docker compose volume section or your actual file path for more help.


**You are very close!**  
Your file **exists** at `/app/media/deals/deal_image_bEWtzPM.jpg` inside the container, and your nginx config is set to:

```nginx
location /media/ {
    alias /app/media/;
    ...
}
```

But you are still getting a 404. This means one of the following is happening:

---

## **Checklist for nginx media 404**

### 1. **Is nginx running on the same host as your Django container?**
- If nginx is running on the host, but `/app/media/` is inside the Docker container, nginx on the host **cannot see** the files.
- **Solution:** You must mount the media directory as a Docker volume to the host, and point nginx to the host path.

### 2. **Is nginx running inside a container?**
- If nginx is in a container, is it sharing the `/app/media/` volume with Django?
- Both containers must have the same volume mounted at `/app/media/`.

### 3. **Is the file readable by nginx?**
- Permissions look fine if you can `ls` as root, but nginx may run as `www-data` or `nginx` user.

---

## **How to Fix (Most Common Case: nginx on Host, Django in Docker)**

### **A. Mount the media directory to the host**

In your `docker-compose.yml` for Django:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./media:/app/media
```
This makes `./media` on your host the same as `/app/media` in the container.

### **B. Point nginx to the host directory**

Change your nginx config:
```nginx
location /media/ {
    alias /path/to/your/host/media/;
    ...
}
```
- If your project is at `/home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin`, then:
  ```nginx
  alias /home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin/media/;
  ```

### **C. Reload nginx**

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

| Setup                        | What to do                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| nginx on host, Django Docker | Mount media to host, point nginx to host path   |
| nginx in Docker              | Use same volume for both containers             |
| Both on host                 | No change needed if paths match                 |

---

## **Example: Correct nginx config for host**

```nginx
location /media/ {
    alias /home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin/media/;
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Update your docker-compose.yml** to mount the media directory to the host.
2. **Update nginx config** to use the host path for `alias`.
3. **Reload nginx**.
4. **Test the image URL again.**

Let me know if nginx is running on the host or in Docker for a precise fix.

A **403 Forbidden** from nginx when accessing a static/media file almost always means a **file or directory permissions problem**.

---

## **Why This Happens**

- nginx (running as user `www-data` or `nginx`) does not have permission to read the file or one of its parent directories.
- The file exists, but is not world-readable, or the directory is not world-executable.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **1. Fix Permissions on the Media Directory and Files**

Run these commands on your server:

```bash
# Make all files in media world-readable
sudo chmod -R a+r /root/minglin_backend/media

# Make all directories in media world-executable (needed for traversal)
sudo find /root/minglin_backend/media -type d -exec chmod a+rx {} \;
```

### **2. (If Needed) Fix Parent Directory Permissions**

nginx must be able to traverse all parent directories. Make sure `/root` and `/root/minglin_backend` are at least executable by others:

```bash
sudo chmod o+x /root
sudo chmod o+x /root/minglin_backend
```

> **Note:** For security, it's better to move your media/static directories out of `/root` and into a less privileged directory (e.g., `/srv/minglin_backend/media`). But the above will work.

---

## **3. Reload nginx (if you changed config)**

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

---

## **4. Test Again**

Visit the image URL in your browser.  
You should now see the image.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `chmod -R a+r media` | Makes all files readable |
| `find media -type d -exec chmod a+rx {}` | Makes all dirs traversable |
| `chmod o+x /root` | Allows traversal into /root (needed for nginx) |

---

**If you want to avoid making `/root` world-executable, move your project to `/srv/` or `/opt/` or your home directory.**

---

Let me know if you want a command to move your project to a safer location, or if you want to proceed with the above!

**Yes, you should do the same with static files!**

The best practice for Django + Docker + nginx is:

- **Mount the static directory from your Django container to a host directory** (using a Docker volume).
- **Point nginx’s `alias` to the host directory** for `/static/` (just like for `/media/`).

---

## **How to Set Up Static Files with Docker and nginx**

### **1. Docker Compose: Mount Static Directory**

In your `docker-compose.yml` for Django:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./media:/app/media
      - ./static:/app/static
```
- This makes `./static` on your host the same as `/app/static` in the container.

### **2. nginx Config: Use Host Path for Static**

Update your nginx config:
```nginx
location /static/ {
    alias /home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin/static/;
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```
- Replace the path with the actual path to your project’s `static` directory on the host.

### **3. Collect Static Files**

Inside your Django container, run:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
- This will copy all static files to `/app/static` (which is also `./static` on your host).

### **4. Reload nginx**

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

## **Summary Table**

| File Type | Docker Compose Volume         | nginx Alias Path (host)                                 |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Media     | `- ./media:/app/media`       | `/home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin/media/`  |
| Static    | `- ./static:/app/static`     | `/home/emmanuel/Documents/MyProjects/ZirconProjects/minglin/static/` |

---

## **Why This Works**

- **Django writes files to `/app/static` and `/app/media` inside the container.**
- **Docker mounts those directories to the host.**
- **nginx serves files directly from the host, not from inside the container.**
